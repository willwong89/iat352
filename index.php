	<h1>Objective</h1>
	<p>SIAT program is only 10 years old. An essence of SIAT program, a unique combination of computing media and design, and its potential for graduates, is not well understood between high school students and their parents. SIAT wants to provide better information to potential students and their parents. One strategy is to connect current SIAT students and alumni with high school students. Furthermore, rather than knowing how some other guy or gal do in SIAT, high school students may appreciate seeing someone from their highschool to succeed. </p>

	<h1>Technical Details</h1>
	<p>This project uses variety of web development technology. Languages, such as HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, are used to develop this system. Beside the presentation layer, a database is designed and built in order to persist data of this system. Queries are generated dynamically according to the client's interactions and customizations to populate dynamic data from the database. AJAX is also implemented to refresh and update users' blogs, tweets, and Flickr images in real-time in order enhance the client's experience of using this system by reducing their frustrations as a click to refresh the system is no longer required.</p>
